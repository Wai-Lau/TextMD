# What it is
A life saving app, built to help people stay healthy, and save time and money too!

# Inspiration
We wanted to build an application to help everyone, elderly, and non elderly alike to stay healthy. By doing so we realized an awesome combination of products and services that make our application great.

# What it does
TextMD is a way to communicate with a medical team fast, from the comfort of just about anywhere. By text message, there is no other software or application to download or install, just send a message containing your information, and voila. The medical team will see your case, read your information, and provide you with top quality medical advice, without the need to risk the travel to the doctors office, or the risk of infection or contamination in the waiting room.

# How we built it
Using Twilio, users can send text messages to our number, where they will meet our friend IBM - Watson. Through a small conversation with Watson, our medical staff will receive all the information we need to make smart and informed diagnoses and treatment suggestion.

# Challenges we ran into
There was an issue with setting up Twilio locally for testing purposes. Then we struggled to get React working in the way we wanted. Through the struggle we managed to tackle both. The last challenge was to connect the output from the Watson conversation to be stored and parsed into a Firebase database.

# What we learned
We learned a lot about all of these services. For some, our first look into machine learning and artificial intelligence. For others, building a system with React, and connecting two Docker containers. And finally, for some, constructing a middle and backware that connects the whole project together.

# What's next for TextMD
We want to add some additional features to TextMD such as, scheduled medical reminders for pills and such, automated triage and diagnoses when applicable, and integration with text to speech software.
